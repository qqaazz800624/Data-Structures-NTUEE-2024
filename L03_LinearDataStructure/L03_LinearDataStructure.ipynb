    "<!-- * Linear data structures maintain their data in an ordered fashion. -->\n",
    "* Stacks are simple data structures that maintain a LIFO, last-in first-out, ordering.\n",
    "* The fundamental operations for a stack are `push`, `pop`, and `isEmpty`.\n",
    "* Queues are simple data structures that maintain a FIFO, first-in first-out, ordering.\n",
    "* The fundamental operations for a queue are `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `isEmpty`.\n",
    "<!-- * Prefix, infix, and postfix are all ways to write expressions. -->\n",
    "<!-- * Stacks are very useful for designing algorithms to evaluate and translate expressions. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stacks can provide a reversal characteristic.\n",
    "* Queues can assist in the construction of timing simulations.\n",
    "<!-- * Simulations use random number generators to create a real-life situation and allow us to answer “what if” types of questions. -->\n",
    "* Deques are data structures that allow hybrid behavior like that of stacks and queues.\n",
    "* The fundamental operations for a deque are `addFront`, `addRear`, `removeFront`, `removeRear`, and `isEmpty`.\n",
    "<!-- * Lists are collections of items where each item holds a relative position. -->\n",
    "* A linked list implementation maintains logical order without requiring physical contiguous storage requirements.\n",
    "* Modification to the head of the linked list is a special case.\n"
